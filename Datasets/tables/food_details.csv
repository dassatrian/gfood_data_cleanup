Moisture, tocopherols, I and B1 were determined in white rolls purchased in Sydney and Melbourne in 2000. B12 was imputed from regular white bread. Folic acid was estimated using the approximate flour content of bread and the folic acid content of flour for bread making after taking into account baking losses (200 ug/100 g). Iodine was estimated using the salt content to first estimate the analysed Na content of the bread, after adjusting for naturally occurring Na and Na from food additives (estimated at a total of 16 mg/100 g). The iodine contributed from this salt was then estimated assuming an iodine concentration in the salt of 45 mg per kilogram, assuming a 10% loss on baking. The iodine estimated from iodised salt (approximately 45 mcg/100 g) was then added to the naturally occurring iodine level previously measured in white bread (approximately 3 mcg/100 g) to determine the total iodine content after fortification.

Proximates and carotenes were derived from a composite sample of multiple purchases of 2 brands (Universal Bakeries and Homebake) in Adelaide in 1988. Folic acid was estimated using the approximate flour content of bread and the folic acid content of flour for bread making after taking into account baking losses (200 ug/100 g). Iodine was estimated using the salt content to first estimate the analysed sodium content of the bread, after adjusting for naturally occurring sodium and sodium from food additives (estimated at a total of 16 mg/100 g). The iodine contributed from this salt was then estimated assuming an iodine concentration in the salt of 45 mg per kilogram, assuming a 10% loss on baking. The iodine estimated from iodised salt (approximately 45 mcg/100 g) was then added to the naturally occurring iodine level previously measured in white bread (approximately 3 mcg/100 g) to determine the total iodine content after fortification.

Iodine was estimated using the salt content to first estimate the analysed Na content of the bread, after adjusting for naturally occurring Na and Na from food additives (estimated at a total of 16 mg/100 g). The iodine contributed from this salt was then estimated assuming an iodine concentration in the salt of 45 mg per kilogram, assuming a 10% loss on baking. The iodine estimated from iodised salt (approximately 45 mcg/100 g) was then added to the naturally occurring iodine level previously measured in white bread (approximately 3 mcg/100 g) to determine the total iodine content after fortification.
